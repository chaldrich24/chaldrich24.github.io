            <p>
                As seen in the web page title, my name is Chad Aldrich. I currently work as a financial analyst for
                Leidos located in the DC metro area. I graduated from James Madison University in 2019 and desiring
                to progress into more complex subjects, I applied and joined this coding bootcamp for full-stack web
                development. Ultimately, I’m hoping with these new experiences compounded by my previous educational
                and professional background, I’ll leverage myself into a new position working full stack development
                in the tech industry. As for who I am apart from my professional goals, I love to read, either non-fiction
                or fiction, on any subjects ranging from philosophy and history to novels on the American West in the
                19th century. I’m also an avid sports fan with a preference for American football and baseball.
                Lastly, I consider myself a creative person and love learning new things, with right now my focus on
                piano playing and music production.
